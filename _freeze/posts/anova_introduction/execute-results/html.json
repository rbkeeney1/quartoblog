However, ANOVA uses a categorical predicting variable while SLR's is quantitative. Essentially, ANOVA is a linear regression model where the predicting factor is a categorical variable. ANOVA uses dummy variables with categorial predictors. With multiple predictors, it's a multiple linear regression.\n\n**ANOVA Assumptions:**\n\n-   Constant variance: The variance of the error terms is constant\n\n-   Independence: The error terms are independent random variables\n\n-   Normality: The error terms are normally distributed\n\nAdditional Material:\n\n-   [ANOVA tutorial](https://datascienceplus.com/one-way-anova-in-r/)\n\n-   [ANOVA Math](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~boli/stat512/lectures/topic6.pdf)\n\n-   [Understanding ANOVA in R](https://bookdown.org/steve_midway/DAR/understanding-anova-in-r.html)\n\n## Example ANOVA output in R\n\nJet lag is a common problem for people traveling across multiple time zones, but people can gradually adjust to the new time zone since the exposure of the shifted light schedule to their eyes can resets the internal circadian rhythm in a process called \"phase shift\". Campbell and Murphy (1998) in a highly controversial study reported that the human circadian clock can also be reset by only exposing the back of the knee to light, with some hailing this as a major discovery and others challenging aspects of the experimental design. The table below is taken from a later experiment by Wright and Czeisler (2002) that re-examined the phenomenon. The new experiment measured circadian rhythm through the daily cycle of melatonin production in 22 subjects randomly assigned to one of three light treatments. Subjects were woken from sleep and for three hours were exposed to bright lights applied to the eyes only, to the knees only or to neither (control group). The effects of treatment to the circadian rhythm were measured two days later by the magnitude of phase shift (measured in hours) in each subject's daily cycle of melatonin production. A negative measurement indicates a delay in melatonin production, a predicted effect of light treatment, while a positive number indicates an advance.\n\nRaw data of phase shift, in hours, for the circadian rhythm experiment.\n\n| Treatment | Phase Shift (hr)                                    |\n|:----------|:----------------------------------------------------|\n| Control   | 0.53, 0.36, 0.20, -0.37, -0.60, -0.64, -0.68, -1.27 |\n| Knees     | 0.73, 0.31, 0.03, -0.29, -0.56, -0.96, -1.61        |\n| Eyes      | -0.78, -0.86, -1.35, -1.48, -1.52, -2.04, -2.83     |\n\nRunning an ANOVA data in R results in the following output. You can read the \"treatments\" as the \"between\" variability and the \"error\" as the \"within\" variability - the ratio between the two are then compared in the F-test.\n\n|   Source   | Df  | Sum of Squares | Mean Squares | F-statistics | p-value |\n|:----------:|:---:|:--------------:|:------------:|:------------:|:-------:|\n| Treatments |  2  |     7.2244     |    3.6122    |     7.29     |  0.004  |\n|   Error    | 19  |     9.415      |    0.4955    |              |         |\n|   TOTAL    | 21  |    16.6394     |              |              |         |\n\nFor reference, here is the same table with the parameters named.\n\n+------------+-------+----------------+---------------------+-----------------+---------+\n| Source     | Df    | Sum of Squares | Mean Squares        | F-statistics    | p-value |\n+:==========:+:=====:+:==============:+:===================:+:===============:+:=======:+\n| Treatments | $k-1$ | $SSTR$         | $MSTR=$             | $F= MSTR / MSE$ | \\*      |\n|            |       |                |                     |                 |         |\n| (between)  |       |                | $STR/ (k-1)$        |                 |         |\n+------------+-------+----------------+---------------------+-----------------+---------+\n| Error      | $N-k$ | $SSE$          | $MSE = SSE / (N-k)$ |                 |         |\n|            |       |                |                     |                 |         |\n| (within)   |       |                |                     |                 |         |\n+------------+-------+----------------+---------------------+-----------------+---------+\n| TOTAL      | $N-1$ | $SST$          |                     |                 |         |\n+------------+-------+----------------+---------------------+-----------------+---------+\n\nWhere:\n\n-   k = 3 (number of groups)\n-   N = 22 (number o data points)\n-   Treatment Df = K-1 = 3-1 = 2\n-   Error Df = N-k = 22 - 3 = 19\n-   TOTAL Df = 2 and 19\n-   SSTR = MSTR \\* Df = 3.6122 \\* 2 = 7.2244\n-   MSE = SSE/Df = 9.415 / 19 = 0.4955\n-   SST = SSE + SSTR = 7.2244 + 9.415 = 16.6394\n-   F-statistic = MSTR/MSE = 3.6122 / 0.4955 = 7.29\n\n### Group Means\n\n-   $\\mu_1$: estimated mean of the treatment group \"control\" = -0.31\n-   $\\mu_2$: estimated mean of the treatment group \"knees\" = -0.36\n-   $\\mu_3$: estimated mean of the treatment group \"eyes\" = -1.55\n\n### Null hypothesis of the ANOVA $F$-test, $H_0$\n\n$H_0$: All the means of treatment categories are the same.\n\n### Alternative hypothesis of the ANOVA $F$-test, $H_A$\n\n$H_A$: At least one pair of treatment categories have different means.\n\n### F-test, p-value, and results\n\nThe resulting p-value from the F-test $F$(k-1, N-k) or $F_{(2,19)}$ is 0.004. At the level of $\\alpha$-level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis, so at least 1 pair of the treatment groups' means are likely different (statistically significant). However, without pairwise comparison, we do not know which pair(s) are different. Additional analysis is needed to evaluate the control group vs the knee and eye treatment groups.\n\n### R Code\n\nSince the samples are different length, I use a quick trick of combining them into a single tibble with a \"name\" and \"value\" column.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\n\nControl = tibble(\n  name = \"Control\",\n  value = c(0.53, 0.36, 0.20, -0.37, -0.60, -0.64, -0.68, -1.27)\n)\n\nKnees = tibble(\n  name = \"Knees\",\n  value = c(0.73, 0.31, 0.03, -0.29, -0.56, -0.96, -1.61)\n)\n\n\nEyes = tibble(\n  name = \"Eyes\",\n  value = c(-0.78, -0.86, -1.35, -1.48, -1.52, -2.04, -2.83)\n)\n\n\n# bind into tibble  \ndata = rbind(Control,Knees) |> rbind(Eyes)\n\ndata |> sample_n(5) # randomly show 5 rows\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 5 x 2\n  name    value\n  <chr>   <dbl>\n1 Control  0.36\n2 Control -0.68\n3 Control  0.53\n4 Knees   -0.56\n5 Eyes    -1.48\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nWith this done, we can quickly check the means.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata |>  group_by(name) |> dplyr::summarise(n = n(), mean=mean(value), var = var(value))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n# A tibble: 3 x 4\n  name        n   mean   var\n  <chr>   <int>  <dbl> <dbl>\n1 Control     8 -0.309 0.381\n2 Eyes        7 -1.55  0.499\n3 Knees       7 -0.336 0.625\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nMake a quick boxplot using ggplot.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndata |>\n  ggplot(aes(x=name, y=value, fill = name))+\n  geom_boxplot()+\n  geom_jitter(size=2, alpha = 0.5,width = 0.2)+ \n  theme_bw() +\n  theme(\n      legend.position=\"none\",\n      ) +\n  labs(\n    title = \"Boxplot\",\n    x = \"\"\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](anova_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-6-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnd finally run ANOVA.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naov_model <- aov(value~name, data = data)\naov_model\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\nCall:\n   aov(formula = value ~ name, data = data)\n\nTerms:\n                    name Residuals\nSum of Squares  7.224492  9.415345\nDeg. of Freedom        2        19\n\nResidual standard error: 0.7039492\nEstimated effects may be unbalanced\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\naov_model |> summary()\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n            Df Sum Sq Mean Sq F value  Pr(>F)   \nname         2  7.224   3.612   7.289 0.00447 **\nResiduals   19  9.415   0.496                   \n---\nSignif. codes:  0 '***' 0.001 '**' 0.01 '*' 0.05 '.' 0.1 ' ' 1\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nChecking the fit of the model, we see that all three assumptions hold, but note there are a few points identified as possible outliers.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nplot(aov_model)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](anova_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-1.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](anova_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-2.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](anova_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-3.png){width=672}\n:::\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](anova_introduction_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-12-4.png){width=672}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nRemember, ANOVA doesn't tell us *which* pair is different, only *if* a pair exists with statistically different means.\n\nWe can use **TukeyHSD** to identify which groups are different to the others through pair-wise comparison. *Eyes* is determined to have a mean that is statistically different than the *Control* and *Knees* groups while the *Control* and *Knees* groups do not statistically different means.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nTukeyHSD(aov_model)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n```\n  Tukey multiple comparisons of means\n    95% family-wise confidence level\n\nFit: aov(formula = value ~ name, data = data)\n\n$name\n                     diff        lwr        upr     p adj\nEyes-Control  -1.24267857 -2.1682364 -0.3171207 0.0078656\nKnees-Control -0.02696429 -0.9525222  0.8985936 0.9969851\nKnees-Eyes     1.21571429  0.2598022  2.1716263 0.0116776\n```\n:::\n:::\n",
